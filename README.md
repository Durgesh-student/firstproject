 * My First HTML Project Portfolio Resume Website *
I've created my first portfolio resume website using pure HTML as part of my frontend learning journey. I intentionally started with HTML only to understand:
       *Page structure
       *Semantic tags
       *Proper layout

   
FOR ME:
         HTML is the bones of a website (structure)
          CSS is the skin(design)
         JavaScript brings activeness (interactivity)
         
*** To develop and manage my project, I used:
      1)VS Code as my code editor
      2) Git for version control
      3)GitHub to host and manage my code repository
      
      *I learned how to connect VS Code with GitHub, initialize a repository, commit changes, and push my HTML project to GitHub.
      
** I developed this project using:

 *VS Code for coding
 *Git for version control
 *GitHub to host and publish the project

 *Next step: enhancing the same project with CSS, and later JavaScript.
 
 *Learning step by step and building strong fundamentals
 
      I'm at the beginning of my frontend journey.
                    Would love to connect with fellow learners and developers and learn together."
